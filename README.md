Spriteful
=========
A jQuery-based 2d isometric game engine built for modern web browsers. 

The goal is to provide a powerful web-based game engine using idiomatic jQuery so that anyone who is already familiar with jQuery can use Spriteful to easily build sprite-based games.

Spriteful is heavily inspired by [Paul Bakaus's talk on the Aves Engine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RRnyChxijA).

To view an example, open static/index.html in a modern browser (preferably Chrome).

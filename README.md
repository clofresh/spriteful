Spriteful
=========
A jQuery-based 2d isometric game engine built for modern web browsers. 

The goal is to provide a powerful web-based game engine using idiomatic jQuery so that anyone who is already familiar with jQuery can use Spriteful to easily build sprite-based games.

Spriteful is heavily inspired by [Paul Bakaus's talk on the Aves Engine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RRnyChxijA).

Dependencies:

* [Tornado](http://tornadoweb.org/)
* [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)

To run:

    python python/spriteful.py

Then go to [http://localhost:8888/static/index.html](http://localhost:8888/static/index.html) in a modern browser like Chrome.
